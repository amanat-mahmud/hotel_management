## ❓Problem Statement
Despite a significant customer base and a reasonable average daily rate, the hotel chain faces challenges in customer retention, revenue growth, and market diversification. The high proportion of non-repeating customers and the decrease in revenue despite increased average daily rates indicate potential issues in customer satisfaction, pricing strategy, and market positioning. Additionally, the concentration of customers from Portugal suggests an over-reliance on a single market, which could pose risks to long-term sustainability.

## 🎯 Objective
The primary objective is to:
1. Enhance revenue growth while maintaining competitive pricing
2. Improve customer retention rates
3. Diversify the customer base beyond the Portuguese market
4. Optimize room allocation strategies
5. Refine pricing strategies across different seasons and customer segments
6. Improve overall customer experience to encourage repeat visits
7. Expand marketing efforts to attract a more diverse international clientele
8. Analyze and address the discrepancy between increased daily rates and decreased revenue
